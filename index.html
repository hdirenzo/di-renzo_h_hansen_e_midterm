		Why coffee is not good 
	</h1>
	<h2>By Evan Hansen</h2>

		Coffee is a glorified roasted bean water worshipped by millions accross the world. It is a cornerstone of North American culture found in every major chain resturaunt and cafe as well as every home and workplace. The first thought on many minds in the morning is a cup of fresh steaming hot brew. However the mental, physical, and human cost of coffee far exceeds it's benefits.

		Hi, I'm Evan and today we will explore the truth of the classic cup of joe everyone over the age of 16 seems to love. From high schoolers, to college students, to white collar workers, coffee is a commodity saught after by everyone everywhere. It is bizarre then that the natural state of coffee sucks ass, and tastes just like it. The rejuvinating drink is black and bitter, an oral hazard some might say, with an earthy and thin flavour. Many people know this and drink it black; these are known as social outcasts. But to the rest of the world, coffee is infused with an arsenal of pleasant ingredients such as sugar, milk, creme, caramel, hot chocolate, just to make the drink enjoyable to the common palette. For such a common drink it's a wonder why so much effort is put into making the average cup of joe what it is, when those resources could be better spent on literally any other beverage.
		<br>
		Coffee has a bizarre effect on the human body. The primary effect of coffee is to administer caffeine to the brain which blocks natural hormones that induce drowsiness. It fulfills this purpose quite well, but it has other strange effects. It makes you poop, and increases your heart rate which can be dangerous for some with high blood pressure. Not a good trade-off I'd say! Coffee comparatively also has a lower caffeine concentration than chocolate so it is not even the most effective distributor of caffeine.
		<br>
		Coffee is also one of the most farmed produce in the world. The farmers who grow coffee are often paid next to nothing and live in poor conditions. It's shipping and handling also has a profound burden on the health of the planet and tons of emmissions are created by distributing coffee to various regions of the world.
		<br>
		It is for these reasons that coffee sucks. It takes a bunch of extra stuff to make it taste good, it gives adverse side-effects for your body, and it is bad for the environment. Stop it. No. No! Bad Coffee. Bad!
