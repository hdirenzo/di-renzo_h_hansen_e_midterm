    <title>Is Coffee Really That Good? </title>
<section>

    <h2>Coffee is a Life Source</h2>
    <p>Coffee is amazing. Coffee is a staple in many households. And for a good reason.
        Coffee has many health benefits, such as burning fat, increasing energy, 
        can lower type 2 diabetes, may protect your liver, and contains many
        nutirents. Not only this, coffee is a wonderful beverage to share with friends
        and loved ones. Having a warm cup of coffee can be one of the most soothing
        and intimate experiences. Many people look forward to enjoying a cup
        of coffee with a good book. Coffee can be made several different ways
        by many different cultures. Some popular types of coffee around the world
        are french press, espresso, cafe latte, cappuccino, flat white, cortado, 
        americano, iced coffee, turkish coffee, irish coffee, etc, etc. Coffee is also 
        a huge part of many cultures around the world. Italians are known for thier
        espresso, and espresso drinks. They drink warm espresso all year round, and there
        is the unwritten rule that you may not have a cappuccino before noon, and 
        in the summer cafe granita, an iced slushy type coffee is popular. In South
        Korea, there are many cafes where you will almost always see someone drinking
        the classic Korean Iced American. Furthermore, in Cuba, the classic Moka pot 
        that makes cuban coffee, basically an espresso made on a stove top. Coffee also smells and looks great. It's super austhetic, especially if you're
        a regular instagram foodie. 

        In italy, there is a common phrase, Tutto e' possibile dopo il caffe'. 
        Anything is possible after coffee. I couldn't agree more. If Keanu Reeves
        likes coffee, it must be good, right?
